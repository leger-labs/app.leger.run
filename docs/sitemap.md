# en vrac:

- account settings

- release config ui is central, and it is orthoginal to the api secrets ("integrations") which are more static. this looks like main-config-management1. there is also a meta settings page for each release; as seen in project-settings2

- releases is the timestamped complete configurations, can create new

- services is like vercel's installed integrations console. there is an integrations console, and a link to the marketplace

- marketplace when logged in has direct install button. overall centralized view with tags

- we have the connectable accounts section that is different from the integrations marketplace. this is for adding third party api s.

- for leger there should be a dedicated models page

- equivalent to security page: by default enabled, this is the configuration for caddy and cockpit


env variables entry is done like in the env7 picture; this is where the user can see api keys
