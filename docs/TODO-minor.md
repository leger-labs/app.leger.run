Note: we add a "custom model" entry with huggingface logo: asks user to add a huggingface url; and user gives the model a name
fix groq logo, all the logos into smaller and that have a circle backdrop
- in the brand kit we must fix the grey sections for the menu in the dark mode, and more importantly make the default color black not blue. we remove the blue component
fix the two-time api key entry in "providers" there should only be one menu
